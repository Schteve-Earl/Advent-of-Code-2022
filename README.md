# Advent-of-Code-2022

This is a repo that (hopefully) stores every solution for the 2022 Advent of Code challenges. To run any of these solutions, start by downloading the Rust toolchain, 
which can be found here: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

After installing, pat yourself on the back. You deserve it.

Next, clone this repo and cd into any folder for any day. Then, execute
```
cargo run
```
in the terminal to watch the magic happen. Finally, replace the values in the input.txt file with your values (they won't be the same), and execute 
```
cargo run
```
in the terminal. Copy and paste the answers into solution box, collect your two gold stars, and enjoy the empty feeling in your heart because you cheated
at Advent of Code
